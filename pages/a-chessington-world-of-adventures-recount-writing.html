    <h1>A Chessington: World of Adventures Recount</h1>
    <h2>2020</h2>
    <br>
The lean-to structures: the Sheriff’s Office 🤠 (a security watchtower🗼📡); the
Blacksmith’s Forge 🔨 (a new giftshop); the unconvincing Jailhouse (perfect for
novelty photo 📸 opportunities); the Saloon Bar 🍻 (for “Sncks 🍔🌭 nd Rfrshmnts 􀀀”
[courtesy of those who stole the vowels]); the Haunted Mineshaft 👻 ⛏ entrance
(propped up behind a wooden queuing system) and the Shooting Range 🔫 (where I
stand). Most of these elements still hide tumbledown versions 🏚 of their previous
selves 🏠 – those which I became familiar with as I arrived here. The whispered plans
for expansion had clearly gone to shit 💩 /, or up the creek 🛶. [...] Inside strained
dreams: I’m sure they are skimping on the power ⚡ I’m fed 🤤 and paid 💸💸💸 with
– or maybe I’m just past my best, with repairs 🔧 becoming noticeably frequent
these past few months 📅 (I won’t admit this fact though). ///The static whir of an
empty electrical speaker 🔈 system before the needle lifts the twangy guitar 􀀀 and
galloping melody 🐎🎼 to life. The absence of sub-sonics 🔊 in the repetitive theme
pipe an echoing whine 🎻 that meanders through the breeze 💨, as I return to my
body with the power’s ⚡ reengagement./// Today felt cooler ❄, I reckoned. Cooler
❄. I believe it felt cooler ❄ as the tune made its third pass (already).
*Motor oil ⛽ (used as) joint lubricant: snaking 🐍 from wooden ass-crack to wooden
upper inner thigh – granting potential for an imaginable shiver 􀀀.*
And I have no idea how big the park is 📏, nor how extensive its amusements are
🤡🤹 ♀🎠🎢🎡. Bastardized for generations, I know it houses several generically
themed areas. My first experience of these was a ‘Hall of Presidents’ 🇺🇸 - Dutch
Angle glimpsed when two beefcake workmen 👷 ♂👷 ♂ dropped my box. Pretend
searing pain in my lower back, then, while being welded onto an almost-exoskeleton
☠, followed by a clumsy installation of ancient wires, fettering me into the park’s
sickly pulse 🤒 like a primordial life support device, with no degree of change to the
power ⚡output feeding into me for the first few months 📅 whatsoever. You
imagine the generators vibrating overnight, overfeeding 🤢 and burning great red
holes ⭕⭕⭕ around internal joints 💪🦵, while I stand haemorrhaging motor oil ⛽.
*Again here, Motor oil ⛽ lingers on wooden inner thigh before proceeding further
downwards ⬇*
The main square shares multiple attributes with the far off invention of Potemkin
Villages 🇷🇺 – demonstrated one morning when two men in suits 👔 and hard-hats
⛑􀀀 drinking coffee ☕ from disposable cups stopped briskly outside my range and
revealed that this square was erected atop the remnants of a far older ‘Prehistoric
Island’ 🌋 - a realm that I assumed had belonged to the corporation that was here
even before my employers (?). You see the faces of customers in lax disappointment.
And shaking heads 🤦 ♀, crossed arms 🙅 ♂. Hunched shoulders. Crawling machines
trampling the rockeries 🏗, dislodging this part of prehistoric 🦖🦕 (almost) reality
from its physical space, and its slow and ancient time 🕰. The claws then digging
deep and hauling the whole zone North 􀀀, like an army of automated tugboats
🚢🚢🚢, leaving behind a blunt, stumpy architecture in a pie-bowl 🥧 crater of dry
dirt… The whole act still complying with the customer’s desire for convenient
authenticity (of course), an authenticity that is palatable (able to be consumed -
swallowed). This land pines to be consumed. It was crafted -
all for the gut
- designed with the gut in mind, and custom built to bypass (the mental gag reflex 🤮
between) human pain and pleasure. I meditate on my visitors’ ideas of authenticity,
with their secret knowledge that histories can simply be erased and moved in an
expensive 💰 and almost mechanical flash 📸, pertaining to a fickle reversal: an
excess of authenticity granted by its own hyperreal falsity. ///Thought interrupted by
intermittent and jagged audio of some members of the board having heard that the
park’s erection on ancient burial grounds could ‘make or break us,’ and at this
remark the other Suit stiffens, with both men promising to keep that idea very hush
hush./// Still, I struggle to imagine what sort of a person would visit a place themed
around the death of Indigenous Peoples. In any event the Wild-West 🤠🐎 sat here
now, slowly melting in the wrath 🔥.
*The stream of motor oil ⛽ splits in two before the bulge of wooden patella, opting
to follow the contours of the back and side of wooden calf*
The isle of dirt standing between my range and the giftshop is almost black, having
been overexposed to the yellow that also bleaches me for around a third of each
day. A small stone wall and a mottled metal bar protect it from the rest of reality. It
is totally infecund, bar two PVC cacti cacti 🌵🌵 and a horse 🐎 melded with a saddle
that is “NOT TO BE CLIMBED!”. The parched waterworks 💦 💦💦 that once cascaded
⛲ from the pistols 🔫 🔫 of a dulled but grinning Cowboy 🤠 have been switched off,
rife with an emerald patina. Expensive maintenance 💰, I supposed - once again
acknowledging how the cowboy’s freckled cheeks ☺ have slowly been windburned
💨🔥 to a leaden gurn 🤪. Perhaps the identity crisis of the park the Suits 👔
sometimes mentioned had an invisible hand 🤚 in the clear lack of repairs to exterior
features.
*Motor oil ⛽ on wooden shin – the stream now slowing*
I imagine this gloved and invisible hand 🤚 as I imagine greeting my co-stars each
morning 🌄, who’s names I conjured up based on their looks alone. There’s Mike - a
handsome and muscular Cowboy 💪🤠, stirrups coolly resting on a wooden table
decorated with poker chips 🎲🎰 and empty metallic tankards 🍻 (each prop in the
scene held in place by a clumsily glued seam: an excessive prevention of potential
theft, here). And Mike has lovely eyes 👀, and soft, buttery looking hands 🙌. And I
assume his waxen face is ruggedly handsome beneath the red bandanna covering his
mouth 👄 (or, as handsome as something resembling a disfigured can encased in a
fleshy layer of industrial paint 🎨 can be). Here, the thickset paint 🎨 seems to
exaggerate his virility somehow, buffering the vague scraping of his painted features
🎨👃👄; all adding up to this image of a metal object brutally molded by stone or
cinderblocks or bricks 􀀀. By hands 🤚 and harsh force – a macho man in his essence
💪👨. If a visitor inserts change into the slot in order to ‘activate’ the range, and
choses to shoot 🔫 their laser at Mike’s sensor, he falls backwards slightly on his chair
􀀀, balancing in limbo – an action quite impossible beyond the mechanically enhanced
physics of the range. His leg􀀀raises from the table, his arm casting his tankard 🍺
skyward, while a dusty khaki StetsonTM jolts upwards ⬆, revealing wily and matted
brown hair peeling from an oily scalp; and then back down ⬇.
There was Paul - a man of few words - by far the oldest thing in the range. He really
looked it too (cracks really starting to show in the varnish especially). A sour face 🍋
puckered impossibly inwards, as if he had been sculpted with expanding foam
instead of paint 🎨 and rubber - dribbling in the dry haze, sheened in a lurid glisten.
His mechanical animation is far simpler than Mike’s, permitted by his ripe age and
assuredly ancient mechanisms 🔩⚙. If a visitor inserts a coin into the slot in order to
‘activate’ the range, and choses to shoot 🔫 their laser at Paul’s sensor, he simply
leans backwards into the shelves behind him, crusty lids grazing eyes 👀 - blue and
empty, while his mouth 👅 clunks open revealing an abyss - bottomless and dry. No
real feat of physics is defied here, as is the case if a visitor chooses to shoot 🔫 their
laser at my sensor. My arms 💪💪 flail upwards, raising my faux Smith and
WessonTM 🔫 (stripped to its skeleton ☠ by teens while I dreamt, some years ago
now) at my audience. My head spins painfully, while my body leans backwards (just
beyond comfort), still anchored ⚓ by my harsh frame.
You can see us here now: we are each a palimpsest, erased ✏ and regenerated
when the sun ☀ bleaches us too harshly or when we are outmoded by a newer,
more convincing version of ourselves. I feel nothing but sympathy towards the
haggard, moth-eaten lump curled on the floor named Toby, who from this angle
doesn’t look very much like a dog 🐶. Toby gets shot 🔫 at the most, letting out tired
whimpers from a knackered speaker 🔉 somewhere inside his lumpen body. Visitors
often call me ‘the bad’: a redux of a silver-screen outlaw, a re-release from the
background of some long lost Western B-side. I’ve caught scattered glimpses of
myself in the reflections of visitor’s sunglasses 🕶; brown chaps, red tasseled shirt
(possibly) with silver brogueing, a barren bandolier completing the look. I have
gathered the parts of my identity, composed myself years apart: a black moustache
(rendered in plastic), grey handsy smears on a contorted toony face plastered with
grin 😁 (from which several oversized teeth 􀀀􀀀􀀀 are painted missing). I feel I am seen
as a man 👨, or perhaps a phenomenally ugly woman 👩 based on the sheer amount
I get shot at 🔫. The only other figure in my line of sight is the back half of a female
figure’s outline - across the tiny desert island 🏝 in the Forge’s bay window. A head of
glistening hair, followed by a long burgundy dress 👗 hanging from cream shoulders.
Mary is a fantasy forbidden to me by my stationary condition. Besides, I could not
abandon my post even if my limbs permitted me, for fear of disappointing my
audience and failing my employers in some way.
Our sedentrary management of the Range fortunately requires no real housekeeping
- other than to keep ourselves working by keeping our minds ticking over 🧠⏰ with
listless recounts such as this. Each of our idiosyncrasies adds to the authenticity of
our display - to my range - which is something I take great pride in. Our brilliant
trifecta (because who really cares about Toby?), manages to balance the seriousness
of our narrative (whatever it is) with the fun associated with shooting firearms 🔫
from a young age.
*stream of motor oil ⛽ passes rim of boot 􀀀, slowly filling around the swollen
wooden foot shape 􀀀 inside*

Sunlight ☀ glances off the various facades 👺🏘 of the square’s buildings. And I
wonder if my legs 􀀀􀀀 will suddenly ache from all the standing I’ve done in this
unchanging saloon. I gaze from the left hand side (visitor’s right) of the range, and
out past the weathered poles maintaining the sagging porch, all the way across hazy
cobblestone walkways and towards the Blacksmith’s Forge 🔨 . Exploring any pixel of
my view in detail, rambunctious joints arch wrongly here and there - wilfully
structural but bulging in the sweaty fug, as if they are freshly pruned branches
leaking thick sap in the swelter. My immediate view appears to be held together by
generous caulking along all visible seams, finished with an approximate pass of
spray-paint – a hint that the less exposed parts of the scene were designed to be
submerged in the ocean 🌊 someday, and for the park to still be able to function.
///Interruption of seeing: a blizzard-white shimmer on black waves.///
- Not a bad view of things, I often admitted: just enough to keep my mind ticking
over, with thoughts running themselves ragged with speculations on whether I had a
higher purpose to serve than standing here, occasionally getting shot 🔫 at and
sometimes reacting.
Visitors could enter my range and stand comfortably shaded by the long mandapam.
On scorchers the air-conditioners inside would be turned up to full blast, and if
enough people stood beneath the porch I pretended I could feel my body cooling ❄,
starting with the puckered fingers on my left hand 🖐 - the part of me that was
nearest my audience. My agonising reaction often proves enough of a reward for the
children, who these days seem far less inclined towards the arcade tickets 🕹🎟 that
come spilling out of a hole in the top of the counter as reward for their accuracy in
the allotted thirty second shooting window ⏱🔫. I feel a rising sense of joy ⬆😊 as I
watch them take aim with their oversized rifles, and then again as they giggle 😂 with
satisfaction as the laser hits one of my sensors, forcing a painful (but clearly hilarious)
reaction.
When they laugh 🤣 at me, I feel no shame as I used to: I would often retreat inside
myself, quivering on the wooden floor of my head 🧠 – a feeling now replaced and
buffered by years of consideration, with a sense of pride in facilitating their strange
enjoyment. I see momentary hatred 😡 on scrunched faces - while they indulge in the
(almost) violence, which is followed by unfathomable joy 🤩 at the mechanical
rewarding of their immorality. Some don’t pay, simply simulating the public
execution with an empty magazine instead. This hysterical play-act cycles in endless
repetition, with the strange but pleasurable agony I feel when I’m shot, in my
opinion, being the most realistic projection available in this town, if not the whole
park. I know this because I feel the cold wrench ❄🔧 – a strange comfort knowing
that I have something tangible to cling to with all digits 🙏.
*Motor oil ⛽ spilling over the rim of a rough, Naugahyde[TM] boot 􀀀, pooling harsh
and dark on wooden floorboards*
[Notice the motor oil ⛽ here: see it as a writhing semiotic liquid, imbued with
strange power.]
The underpaid 💵📉 actors, the cuddly lovers 􀀀👫, the overfed kids who laze through
here each share a meniscus of hyperactive falsity that bobs above the pool of their
character, glazing their eyes 👀 as if they’ve undergone some wild hypnosis 🧙 ♂😴. I
guess it’s how the town 🏫 plays with their heads 🧠. My goal in all of this is
therefore to
blend in completely,
to become
an unthinking component
of my olden surroundings. In terms of my sensorial experience (if I can call it that) I
ponder my innate confusion between corporeal pleasure and pain. I ponder my
experiential importance compared to the unprecedented importance of my
audience’s experience. I have been designed as subservient: I wonder whether to
feign my reactions, and if they can even see 👀 my exertions making a difference
physically. All I know for a fact is that I do not want to come across as a phoney. In
any event, the vague approbation of my audience seems to keep me moving
forwards 🛣, so to speak, and keeps me from the clutches of mindlessness 🧠😵 that I
so often feel looming behind me, unable to turn my head and gaze its gloved and
invisible hand 🤚 silently advancing - an ailment that seems to have befallen my
counterparts, rendering them silent 🤫 and unknowing.

///Noticing: All mornings drag.///
Today was especially sweltering 􀀀. No visitors yet. If I could sweat 😓 I’m sure I would
be (etc.). A few meandering past: fathers and daughters 👨 👧 together for the day –
all fathers clearly eager to leave the park soon in order to beat the pre-empted but
totally fictitious
‘mob’ of others.
Kids running off in every direction - sugar-infused energy 🍬🍭 thwarted by firm
grasps 👊 on wrists. My thoughts drift through the unconvincing middle American
daydream 🇺🇸😴: ‘Mobs’ hadn’t entered this place for years, although one
occurrence always surfaced in my memory: the first time I had ever been shot 🔫 to
figurative smithereens by a kid using a laser pointer he must’ve smuggled past
security. A memory manacled away in a dark corner of my wooden head 🧠, which
on that day must’ve spun into triple figures, my arms 💪💪 flailing animatedly,
snagging in their ancient sockets. The relentless hammering energy 🔨⚡ I received
from the generators I imagine to be hidden behind the set somewhere, forming a
dark heat 🔥 in my wooden thighs, rising to linger in my wooden groin, with all the
energy from my wooden being drawn there. My wooden arms 💪💪 hanging numbly,
wooden elbows feeling nothing while wooden legs 􀀀􀀀 shook violently, the stand
creaking and spitting out swift plumes of dust. A real lump in my hollowed-out chest,
then. My body pulsating its way into blunt contortions. The energy ⚡ in my wires
throbbing to the beat 🥁 of my rocking, while saccharin sweet laughter 🍬🤣 burst
from the lips of my tormentors; regrouping, reforming and resounding again and
again - a ricochet between wooden ears 👂👂. To become relieved through the
basest of feelings, animalised in full discomfort of my visitors, all taking photos 🤳📸
(photography sadly being actively permitted in the park) of my combustion 💥.
Wooden eye 👁sockets aching - a mental pipeline 🧠 had ruptured throughout me.
The maintenance men 🛠 even had to come and stop the ticket machine from
spewing so violently, making a rare and hazy daylight ☀ appearance (although they
just looked like the regular park safety officers 􀀀, still all specky but now wearing
Indiginous headdresses with their sweaty beige shirts, and carrying tomahawks
alongside their toolkits 􀀀). The image of customers watching the borderline
voyeuristic spectacle - the leakage of oil ⛽ from the back of my drainpipe chaps (just
as it leaks from my body now - the damage undergone seemingly irreparable). All
was enough to make me want to fade out, to exit the stage-set. The audience waned
slowly throughout that fateful afternoon I remember, while the repairmen 🛠
welded me back onto my stand once more.
*Streaming motor oil ⛽ seems to falter, the puddle filling it’s usual and deeply
soaked parameter on the wooden floor;
the parameter of a mindless number of identical daily motor oil ⛽ leakages.*
///At noon the heat deadens.///
I think of eager birds 🦅 circling above. I can’t look 👀 to see if there are any. The sky
in the jailhouse windows reflects a luminous FantaTM orange, the cracked plastic
framing the windows having leaked in years of sunlight ☀ causing an unworldly tint
(but I know the sky has to be a pale aegean blue [and completely cloudless] for the
air conditioners ❄ to be whirring so loudly).
While my thoughts flatline under our ancient wooden framing,
I imagine my job’s specification (which I imagine to be filed neatly in an imaginary
and more abandoned part of the park) saying to
remain completely apathetic to the public’s reactions,
and to
the wrenching levels of pain experienced when shot 🔫 at.
It says to
remain living in fear of this pain,
and
the constant dull sting of the sun ☀ cooking the painted skin off my head, burning
my varnished scalp.
I feel my purpose is undermined by even the smallest distractions my visitors
encounter: I am secondary to say, a fly 􀀀 buzzing around them, or a more appealing,
newer structure with more attractive and shiny versions of myself inside. The basest
level of my consciousness – how I feel waking from those dreams - seems to have
been engrained with the idea that I am here to serve the higher purpose of their
enjoyment until I am outmoded, and that is all. ///Audio interruption of: the the
maddening theme-tune revisiting in the air – striking off-chords and pitchy
harmonics – it seems heavier now, like a winding funeral dirge.///
I have higher hopes for the future, and feel as if my fate is not sealed in this sticky,
mock-up saloon. Totally destitute, my main source of humiliation comes from the
mechanics 🛠 when they strip me down to my waxen flesh in front of my audience in
order to fix me, peeling me apart to re-oil ⛽ or re-solder my innards 🔩⚙. It doesn’t
matter if the Suits 👔 who want to ‘keep things neat’ dislike my forced nudity 😣 in
front of my audience or not, because they never seem to find out, and even if they
did the excuses of the grunting mechanics 🛠 - after patting my wooden buttocks -
would be enough to shut them up anyway. I am unable to thwart their movements in
any way: my body stands rigid with catalepsy. I can merely watch 👀 what they do to
me, figuratively biting a metaphorical lip 👄, silently willing that they don’t pry me
apart too harshly, or scratch the inside of my rib-plate with their tools ☠🛠. To them
I am a punchbag-cum-man 🥊👨, preternaturally resistant through my inanimate
being, and this grants me another morsel of joy – in knowing that their purpose lies
in my maintenance.
///The cool end of each day brings physical solace, at least///
the horizon 🌅 dusking beneath the long, ragged veranda. When the enclosure is
switched off and the pretend gas-lamps mute, I am free to wander within dreams
🏃 ♂💭, or, rather exist through lucid hypnogogic hallucinations. (The stupor I enter
each night may be partly due to the fact that the wires running into my lower back
remain half on; the generators churning noisily somewhere.) I step away from my
metal struts, leaping the gun counter 🔫. I am able to glide 🦅 - no - walk over to the
barren island 🏝, looking the cheesy Cowboy 🤠 dead in the eye. I feel - no - touch
the bins, inspect their flecked paintwork, experience their rust. I watch the faux
lamps more clearly, the warm orange glow, ///their low hum/// strangely
comforting. I feel the cobbles - still warm from the sun ☀ - through my boots 􀀀􀀀. I
drift towards Mary’s window, passing straight through the discoloured panes without
shattering them, until I stand next to her, regarding her slender profile, my hand
almost brushing her pale shoulder, hovering there, moments away, as if any
movement could shatter the perfect illusion, the moment trapped in my mind’s eye
🧠👁, engrained onto waxen eyelids I cannot close.
This, followed by a breakneck realisation: as I approach her front, my sheer anxiety is
replaced by horror at the realisation that the limp mannequin is all but featureless:
blindly painted 🎨 gestures on fabric (just hinting at an identity - a look), while all
parts are peeling, reduced to a skeletal ☠ carapace. Staggering backwards reveals
the flies’ feast in full - the whole body an immobile nest of woodworms, of termites,
of flying things gorging themselves 􀀀􀀀􀀀. In an instant the reality of bare flesh is at
once understood and infinitely mystified by the mannequin’s false materiality, by it’s
false humanity.
The creatures flutter through the darkness, becoming mobile through my shock:
bumping into the glass, travelling towards the gas lamps outside (while I regard their
meal, their process). The mundanity of a daily oil leakage ⛽ seems just fine now, my
disappointment in my own defects made infinitesimally small and distant. The horror
of realisation setting my chest into tightening spasms; my legs 􀀀􀀀 no longer working
(or wanting to work). I pulse as I stare 👀, furled energy behind glassy eyes 👁👁:
aghast the rotting thing, at all the misconceptions. I am elevated, and cannot escape
the hold of my physical body, being dragged backwards past the rusty bins, the gaslamps,
the cheesy Cowboy’s rigid smile 🤠 and the long porch of the Range, grasping;
wooden nails scraping along the cobbles before I’m back upright, rigid, re-soldered
onto my stand in the dark. My mind races for countless moments, wishing for the
prelapsarian bliss of mundanity, the endless motor oil leakage ⛽ and the looping
theme tune 􀀀🔊 from before my nightmare, ///as I come back to my body with the
power’s reengagement.///
