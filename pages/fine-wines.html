    <h2>at Set New Cross, 11th - 16th July 2022</h2>
<p>The public realm areas of the undercroft & service yard will be transformed as part
of these proposals as wrenching ammonia, tar & benzene the wholesome air suffers
a thorax simmers at home. A new ceiling & lighting system will brighten the space
& conceal the numerous pipes & cables mounted to the soffit burning of nausea &
itching tears . The garage doors will be replaced with glazed shopfronts for the
new offices. The existing louvers in the opposite south facing wall will be fastened
shut & forever. The Bins area will be screened & new paving to the shared surface
will extend up to the entrance.</p>
<p>Powdercoated aluminium windows are proposed as replacements for the existing.

combination of dark brick & new high quality concrete facings the slogs of your
necktie; They kill inside & never deliver full restitution. The meeting ended.</p>
